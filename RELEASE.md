| Component | Hardware Platform | Description |
| :-------: | :---------------: | :---------: |
| COMPONENT_BLESS-IPC | P6 + BLESS | Represents BLESS protocol talking over IPC |
| COMPONENT_BTSS-IPC | 20829 | Represents BTSS protocol talking over IPC |
| COMPONENT_HCI-UART | P6 + 43xx | Represents HCI as the protocol talking over UART transport |

bluetooth-freertos v3.4.0 has been included as COMPONENT_HCI-UART in btstack-integration. Hence btstack-integration has initial version as 4.0.
